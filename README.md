# Google Assistant Rotary Phone With Dial Functionality
Forked from rydercalmdown/google_assistant_telephone for Google Assistant code
Code reused from hnesland/aselektriskbureau for rotary dial functionality

## Notes
WIP Project. Goal is to have Google Assistant act as the "operator" by dialing 0, then have custom pre-set routines triggered by dialing a predefined, non-zero number.
